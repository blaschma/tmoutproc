This package can be used to process Output of Turbomole Calculations. There is no connection to TURBOMOLE GmbH! The code
still needs some polishing and improvement here and there, as it is developed step by step for scientific projects. 
However, we are working on it and the methods provided are well tested and used in production codes. If you find a bug 
or see room for improvement, please let us know!
